# The "How To" Guide for a Weave GitOps Enterprise trial

Pre-requisites
* A License/Entitlement Key from Weaveworks
* A GitHub account (the best method to ensure success is to use a GitHub token. This resolves any authentication requirements. Creating a personal access token)
* kubectl installed - instructions
* A Kubernetes cluster.  For the example installation, we use kind which requires Docker.

Docker Instructions
* “Kind” Cluster Instructions Getting Started https://docs.gitops.weave.works/docs/getting-started

For the Install a CAPI provider section, specific information and/or credentials may be required for your chosen provider. The documentation for the current Cluster API providers is here. For testing during the trial, Weaveworks recommends using a Kind cluster.

Additional, but optional, configuration steps to utilize a full SQL database (Postgres) can be performed.
